### **Project No# 01:- Disease Prediction:**
üöÄ Excited to share our recent project on Predictive Modeling for Disease Diagnosis! üöÄ
üìä **Objective:**
     -  To develop a predictive model that accurately classifies individuals into diseased or non-diseased categories based on health attributes. This tool aims to support healthcare providers in disease diagnosis and prognosis.

üîç Key Steps:

**Import Libraries:**
  - Utilized essential libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and sklearn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

**Load Data:**
  - Loaded training and test datasets to start the analysis and model development process.

**Data Preprocessing:**
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis and handled missing values to ensure clean datasets.

**Feature Engineering:**
  - Created new features such as BMI squared, Glucose-Cholesterol interaction, and logarithmic transformation of Insulin to enhance model performance.

**Feature Scaling:**
  - Scaled features using StandardScaler to normalize data for better model accuracy.

**Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Employed Random Forest classifier and optimized it using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters.

**Model Evaluation:**
  - Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on both training and test datasets. Achieved high accuracy and robust performance metrics.

**Visualize Feature Distributions:**
  - Visualized data distributions and relationships using scatter plots, pie charts, bar plots, histograms, and sunburst charts to gain deeper insights.
